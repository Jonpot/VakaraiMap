# Flamesquall, Lavashock Haven
The overworld fortress where[[The Watchers]] in charge of [[Vasiliás]] reside. The first outpost of [[The Watchers]], this one has been around for a while. It has been carved into several mountain peaks in [[Lavashock Ridge]]. There are several challenges to living at the top of stormy, active volcanoes, and the people who live here have developed many engineering solutions to these problems:

-   Energy is drawn from the frequent lightning storms to power a stable environment inside of the Fortress, where food can be grown, etc. The energy is captured in Kondensite crystals that are found in the mountains, which give off a certain temperature when charged. The otherwise cold mountains are therefore put at the right temperature for greenhouses as a result.
-   Minerals for plant life were mined from the mountains, and good agricultural practices have led to good soil development in the few outside farms that exist.
-   Bridges were built in between the ridges to allow transportation between them. They are covered, and over time reinforced to be made of stone and iron, so there is very little risk of the bridge collapsing unless there is a major seismic event.
-   Canals were carved into the stone to redirect lava should a volcano erupt.
-   Water from storms is captured.
