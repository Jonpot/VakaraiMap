# Quarestra Savannah
The sprawling savannah in central [[Vakarai]]. It is located to the west of [[Lago Palatano]], [[Crimson Graveyard]], and the [[Shell of Koj]]. This biome is home to the great slumbering [[Da Katavu]] along with a host of wildlife.

Locations of Note:
- [[Da Katavu]]

***Climate Conditions***
- **Temperature**: Can get fairly hot during the day, upwards of 100 degrees. Nights are cooler but still hot, usually 60-70 degrees. Only a little bit cooler during the winters.
- **Precipitation**: Seasonal. Decent rains during the wet season (October-March)
- **Humidity**: Can get pretty darn muggy; RH varies from 70-80% depending on season.
- **Wind/Storms**: Fairly calm during the summers and dry seasons, can pick up a bit more during the wet seasons, but not too much.

***Sub-Biomes***
Like the [[Geyser Flats]], Quarestra Savannah can be divided into several sub-biomes (*motivation: they will be coming to this biome frequently*):
- The **Baobab Forest** is a forest of extremely tall Baobab Trees. The trees are relatively densely clustered, allowing for certain wildlife to fluorish, namely the *baobab spiders*, *primates*, *large birds*, *bats*, *flying squirrels*, and *fire beetles*. This is a dry savanna, meaning the wet season is typically October-March.
- The **Thornbush Safariland** is closer to what one would expect from a Safari trip, full of acacia trees and thorny shrubs. This region is home to *large cats such as panthers, jaguars and tigers, zebras, tapir, jackals, monkeys, lots of birds, monitors, scorpions, fire ants, butterflies, dragonflies, and chameleons*. This is a thornbush savanna, meaning the wet season is typically November-February.
- The **Stampede Plains** is the region with the largest mammal diversity. The royalty of the Stampede plains are the *Quarestra Lions*, but plenty of hordes of mammals are present, including *rhinoceros, wildebeest, elephants, wild horses, and bison.* Also, *hyena, vultures, large lizards, rodents, eagles, hawks, crocodiles, worms, centipedes, giant grasshoppers, and giant crickets* can be found here. The lush elephant grasses that are constantly replenished foster such a grand scale of ecosystems. This is a wet savanna, meaning the wet season is typically late September-mid April.
