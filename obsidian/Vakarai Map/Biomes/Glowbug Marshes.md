# Glowbug Marshes
The glowbug marshes are found between the [[Eastern Vakarai Jungle]] and the [[Allenore Steppes]]. The forest canopy is so thick that no light can make it through the trees. However, the area is full of differently colored glowbugs. The most easily traversed area lies on the river, but light is still required. In many parts of the Glowbug Marshes, this is no problem. However, there are some parts of the swamp in complete darkness with no bugs. The only way to traverse is to lure the bugs to following one around.

***Climate Conditions***
-   **Temperature:** Lack of sun makes this biome cool, but not cold. 60F or so on avg.
-   **Precipitation:** Seasonal.
-   **Humidity:** High.
-   **Wind/Storms:** Low, and marshes tend to serve as environmental barriers to storms anyways.

> [!ERROR]- Additional Environmental Conditions
This is a magically dark environment. The *Daylight* spell can be used to light up the area, but that is it. Other sources of magical light such as the *Light* spell don’t work. Low risk of contracting disease from insects–no rolls necessary (not a lot of mosquitoes or the likes). Overall, climate shouldn’t be a big factor here. The main challenge is lighting the way through.


## Flora and Fauna
### Fauna
**Blue Glowbug.** Responds to harmonics. [Humming Sweetmallow may be an option!]
**Red Glowbug.** Responds to heat.
**Purple Glowbug.** Responds to use of transmutation magic.
**Orange Glowbug.** Responds to scent of a specific flower. [Sweet Water Lily]
**Yellow Glowbug.** Responds to presence of electricity.
**Shadowfrog.** A predator that likes to eat glowbugs. Plenty of prey for them in the glowbug marshes. In low-glowbug zones, party will have to avoid the shadowfrogs to ensure their light source isn’t eaten up. Have a distinct croaking sound.
**Darkwing Heron.** Natural predators of the shadowfrog. Have a distinct bird song. (Mimicking this sound is a potential way to scare off shadowfrogs)

### Flora
> [!INFO]- Flora of the Glowbug Marshes
> - **Twilight Orchid**. Found throughout Vakarai, thrives in low-light conditions.
> - **River Cattail**. Common cattails, relatively easy to find individuals big enough to work with.
> - **Humming Sweetmallow**. A lovely white flower that attracts the blue glowbugs with its faint humming.
> - **Sweet Water Lily**. A small white flower that grows in the wetter areas of the marshes, attracting the orange glowbugs with its pleasant scent.
> - **Riverside Liverwort**. A plant that helps non-amphibious creatures thrive in the marshes. Commonly fed on by small mammals and birds in the marshes. Can be used in herbalism.
> - **Glownode Roots**. An uninteresting plant above ground, but N-fixing nodes on the roots below ground accumulate glowing substance from the soils (which contain a decent amount of dead glowbug detritus). Can be used to light up the swamp unlike other light sources.
> - **Black Lotus**. A rare plant found in marshes, the Black Lotus can be processed to renew someone’s magical energy.
> - **Pale Citrus**. Lack of light means that most plants here aren’t very colorful, including the occasional citrus trees. They provide a strongly acidic fruit that can be brewed into a potion that adapts one to acid. Occasionally collected by Liameni to make a rare liquor.
> - [Moon Willow](https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/max_1200/fd47b778766551.5cae45992962c.png). A rare treasure, this willow lights up brilliantly in the darkest of places via a mutualistic symbiosis with the Blue Canker Larva that lives in its bark. These bugs convert phosphorus from nearby geothermal gas vents into a high-energy molecule using sap from the Willow. In return, the Willow uses the high-energy fertilizer of the larva to grow and fluoresces as a result. Intensely sought after by the Otmen, especially before Ad Vena, which nearly pushed the Willow to extinction.
