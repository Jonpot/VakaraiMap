# Sea of Amber

A desert comprised of shattered fossils and ambers. Navigation is very dangerous since there hasn't been much weathering, so the stone shards are sharp. Not to mention that not everything that resides under the surface is dead…

***Locations of Note***
-   [[Cozcatliani]]

***Climate Conditions***
-   **Temperature:** Hot, although not always unbearable. During the summer, everyone who isn’t adapted to hot climates will be subjected to environmental stress as per the PH. During the spring, only those who are heavily clothed/armored will need to worry about heat stress.
-   **Precipitation:** Sparse. A bit during the winter.
-   **Humidity**: Low.
-   **Wind/Storms:** Low.   

> [!ERROR]- Additional Environmental Conditions
The sea of amber has other problems besides heat–namely the sharp stones that make up the desert floor.
> - The jagged shards of rock that coat the land here are impossible for mounts to traverse. Additional foot protections are necessary in order to traverse safely, and everyone who is traveling through the region needs to roll periodically to determine how their feet are taking the stress. This could include having feet impaled or cut up by stones, or blisters from uncomfortable foot protection. Potential speed reductions will occur as a result of damage to feet in this way.
> - While moving at any pace through the stones besides slowly, stealth is at disadvantage (passive stealth is halved). The stones are very loud and clanky. Other creatures not adapted to the climate will also suffer this penalty.
> - **Sinkholes:** Some of the stone formations are unstable. This poses a potential hazard that could lead to someone getting stuck or drawing attention to predators. Speaking of predators…

## Flora and Fauna
### Fauna

> [!INFO]- **Partially-Fossilized Animals**
**Armadillo.** These stubborn creatures have a very thick shell that has been partially petrified. Despite this it is still light. Not hostile unless attacked, and not much of a fight after that, although they are hard to hit. Their plates can be used to make strong armor.
**Ankylosaurus.** The fossilized ankylosaurus is quite the fright to any who anger it. With a petrified bludgeon for a tail, the creature can brutalize an unarmored enemy with one hit.
**Beetle Swarm.** The partially fossilized beetles are covered in sticky residue, a mix of old tree sap and rot. They often attack living creatures to try and eat them. They don’t deal a lot of damage but can make creatures highly vulnerable to other threats.
**Mongoose.** The enemy of the snake, the mongoose’s resistance to poison allows it to mess up any snake that crosses its path.
**Velociraptor.** Hunting in packs, these dinosaurs, in various states of decay, are very dangerous. Isolating one should allow one to take it down relatively easily. Like to set up ambushes by burrowing under the stones.
**Triceratops.** Brutal when angered, but can be reasoned with, if one can prove they are not a threat. Will defend itself against other dinos.
**Tyrannosaurus.** Rare and savage, the Petrified Tyrannosaurus will strike fear into the hearts of anyone traveling through. Avoid at all costs. 

> [!INFO]- **Other Animals**
**Giant Amber Scorpion.** A person-sized scorpion that hides under the stones, waiting for prey. Tough shell, potent venom. 
**Amber Viper.** A small snake that packs a strong punch with its bite.
**Dusty Hummingbird.** Gray on the outside, but occasionally a flash of rainbow can be seen on the inside of its wings. Common pollinator in the Sea.
