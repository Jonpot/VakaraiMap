A semi-forested wetland region with shallow, warm ponds saturated with colorful salts and bacteria. The geological formations are highly unstable, and high-heat and/or high-acid geysers are known to erupt from the ground under conditions of too much pressure. In other words: tread lightly. This area of the continent is loosely based off Yellowstone. Parts of this biome, more in the south, are also a slightly deeper [mangrove marsh](https://i.imgur.com/0GgLAr4.jpeg). Mangroves can survive in this environment due to the highly salty waters. This regions is highly central, with [[Allenore Steppes]] to the east, [[Promethean Forest]] to the west, [[Sea of Amber]] to the north, and [[Crimson Graveyard]] to the south.

***Climate Conditions***

-   **Precipitation:** Seasonal (snowfall in the winter is common albeit light).
-   **Humidity:** Relatively low.
-   **Wind/Storms:** Gets rather windy in the fall. Thunderstorms aren't unheard of in the winter months, but no crazy blizzards.

> [!INFO]- **Additional Alchemy Notes**
This is a fantastic place to find minerals needed for certain alchemy operations. Several alchemical concoctions of which various people on this continent have recipes for require substances that must be harvested from the geyser pools here.

### Flora (Geyser Flats)
> [!INFO]-  The Flora of Geyser Flats
> - **Conifer Forests.** Several species of pine and fir are common in the foresty areas, including the Stickysap Fir, which is known for the trunks being coated in sap.
> - **Saltbrush Peas**. Grows among the wetland shrubs, and when consumed properly, gives the skin a natural buffer system to acids.
> - **Geothermal Lotus.** A beautiful lotus flower that changes color based on the temperature of the hot spring it is on. They are fairly rare, but can sometimes add some beautiful gradients to the pools of the flats.
> - **Shooting Star Flower.** An oddly shaped pink flower that can make one move faster like a shooting star.
> - **Liameni Paintbrush**. A beautiful flower, and a Liameni favorite because it makes potions more effective.
> - **Geyser Monkshood.** Be careful when seeing this deep purple hood-shaped flower! It will pull a hood over your eyes--and by that I mean it can cause blindness! Hard to process, but makes a poison causing temporary blindness.
