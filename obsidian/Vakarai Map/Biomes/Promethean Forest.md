A magical pine forest that has been imbued with raw elemental energy. This manifests itself in prismatic events that are sometimes harmless, but sometimes produce hazards or spawn elementals. One has to be careful– during a “promethean event,” some trees will spontaneously combust, some trees will shoot lightning from their branches, some will flood the surrounding area, and so on.

***Locations of Note***
- [[Cartef Caled]]

***Climate Conditions***
- **Temperature**: Variable, but generally cold. Mid 20s at night, generally mid 50s during the day, can get as hot as mid 70s. 
- **Precipitation**: Medium-high! Afternoon showers are frequent. 
- **Humidity**: Average.
- **Wind/Storms**: Gets very windy around the evening. Storms are seen infrequently, but are very dangerous when they form.

> [!ERROR]- Additional Environmental Conditions
A dangerous place for anyone to stay long due to the Promethean Events; and yet the Otmen still call it a religious site. Only here do the requisite herbs to build a Vilatti grow. Some say that the winds carry the essence of the weave itself, which imbues the surrounding flora with the wrath of the arcane.

> [!INFO]- Living Stone Eyes
> Usually only seen after a Promethean Event, Living Stones manifest from the earth with glowing purple gems that act as eyes. These are known as Roachava in Otmen culture, and appear to be crystalized lightning. Occasionally, under the right conditions, a smaller Living Stone will be born, referred to as a “Pebble.” Killing and harvesting Roachava is trivial, especially from a Pebble, as they do not seem to be aggressive. The main issue lies with not letting them get away. A larger Living Stone… Now THAT might be a more dangerous issue.

### Flora
Many of the flora present in the Promethean Forest are imbued with wild arcane energy.

> [!INFO]- Plants of the Promethean Forest
> 
> - [Lone Trydan.](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/17/58/9a/17589a6142c5b29a18a64326bf66a1ab.jpg) Usually found on the more rocky outcroppings in the forest, the Lone Trydan tree will grow and produce orbs that glow at night and give a static shock to whoever touches them! During a promethean event, these trees charge up with electricity and shock those that come near it for 2d4 lightning damage, or half as much on a successful DC 13 Dexterity Saving throw. Charging up another shock takes 1d4 rounds.
> - [Crimson Pine.](https://i.redd.it/6ddilqpikqn31.jpg) A tree that sticks out in a forest, these aren’t seen very often. Crimson Pines tower over other trees and are ten times older than all trees around them- this is because they are fire resistant and don’t burn during wildfires. During a promethean event, these trees light the air around them aflame with embers and ash.
> - [Quaking Aspen.](https://psmag.com/.image/t_share/MTU5MjEzNzIxNzQ1MzY4MTM0/fallpando02.jpg) Nothing special, I just love these trees and want them to be in the game. They get their namesake from “quaking” and shivering when the wind blows through their leaves. During a promethean event, these trees create small whirlwinds.
> - **Bouldery Pine**. A pine tree with a thick trunk that bloats geometrically at various points. Along with its granite-like bark, this got its namesake from looking like a pillar of boulders with pine branches sticking out. During a promethean event, these trees cause earthquakes around them.
> - **Giant Strawberry**. Exactly what it says on the tin, these vines stretch out in a 500 foot radius and grow massive, foot-sized strawberries. Edible and delicious! During a promethean event, these can suffice as a tasty snack while you wait out the elements.
> - **Undead Bristlecone Pine**. A rare tree that looks like it ought to be dead, as it has no leaves or pines, scarred wood, and a plethora of abuse from fauna. Despite this, the Undead Bristlecone is very much alive, and survives off of parasitic relationships with the flora around it, sucking nutrients and sugars from the roots of bushes, shrubs, and even small trees using its thorned roots. During a promethean event, the Undead Bristlecone Pine will use its roots to essentially cast the Entangle spell, centered on itself. If a player is caught, at the start of the next round, they must make a DC 15 constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion.
