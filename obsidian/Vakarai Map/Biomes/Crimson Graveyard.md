# Crimson Graveyard

Algae in the murky waters of this swamp give a deep crimson color. The flora of this region climb on top of ancient ruins, some so choked by the grasping vines that only small stone faces are visible. The plants here are predators too, and many of them will hunt animals. It is a warzone here–everything is a predator, and the hot, humid swamp smells of death and decay. Some of the plants are sedentary and rope the unwary in, while others, like shambling mounds, are mobile.

***Locations of Note***
-   You really think anyone wants to live here? They call it "graveyard" for a reason.

***Climate Conditions***
-   **Temperature:** Hot and sluggish.
-   **Precipitation:** High.
-   **Humidity:** VERY high. In combination with the heat, this can pose a significant health risk, and increases disease vectors as well.
-   **Wind/Storms:** Low, which really doesn’t help with the smell.

> [!ERROR]- Additional Environmental Conditions
> - **Mosquitoes** as a vector of disease. Unless the party has developed a working insect repellant, they will be absolutely swarmed by mosquitoes, and as a result will be exposed to Malaria. This requires a disease check. The DC is 16 for Malaria. That’s right, it’s just high enough that they cannot just *Lesser Restoration* it away. No need to roll for mosquitoes–they are always present. Each player needs to roll 1d8 once each day they are in the Crimson Graveyard. Rolling a 1 will force a Con check to see if they are infected with the disease.
> - **Sinkholes.** The soils in some parts of the swamp have the consistency of quicksand.
> - **High-acid areas.** Traversing through low-pH areas can put wear and tear on boots. Not acidic enough to dissolve someone’s feet, but they will certainly be uncomfortable trudging through the swamps without boots on. Without proper protection (such as crafting an acid-resistant substance that can cover the footwear), if this env. condition is rolled, players will have their footgear take damage from this. If this happens twice, their footwear is destroyed.**

## Flora and Fauna
### **Fauna**
> [!INFO]- **Fauna of the Crimson Graveyard**
> - **Crimson Leech.** Traveling through the deeper waters can be dangerous because of the bloodsucking leeches.
> - **Vampire Bat.** Become active at nighttime, and are mostly harmless, unless they are rabid. See Medical Journal for rabies description.
> - **Hardy Porcupine.** Crimson Graveyard porcupines are tough little animals that protect themselves from the lashing of the vine predators using small, sharp quills.

| Purple Deathcap       | Rare     | **Poison Effect**: Releases a potent neurotoxin, which can be captured. Forces a DC 17 Con save.

After an hour, the paralysis kicks in, and they suffer a -10 to speed, as well as a -2 to INT and -2 to WIS until the poison is removed via antidote or spell. The damage taken cannot be healed until the poison is removed. No crafting required–one could just pick up a mushroom and smear it on a sword and that would do the trick.   | n/a |
